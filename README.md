### Really, Another React Starter In 2020?

Parcel is faster than Webpack and there's zero configuration to maintain. If I'm getting started with React in 2020 I want to be able to leverage and speed and agility of Parcel. Sure, I could have used Next.js or any of the other Webpack based starter code, but then I would have never learned how all the bits and pieces work together and I would be at the mercy of those open source projects to fix things.

After spending years with Angular CLI I can't say I'm a big fan of starter code projects. I distributed my last starter code in 2015. CLI tools make it way easier to bootstrap applications. Who knows, maybe this is the beginning of a CLI tool.


## ROADMAP

- cli for generating starter code
- i18n support
